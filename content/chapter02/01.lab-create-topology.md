# Guided Exercise: Configuring the Cloud

This tutorial shows you how to create a basic cloud configuration, with
available gateway, analytics and developer portal services.

## Before You Begin

Make sure that you have completed [Guided Exercise: Installing API Connect v10](../chapter01/01.lab-installation.md).

You will need the following information to complete this tutorial.
* Endpoint (FQDN) of the gateway assigned to accept API requests from clients.
* Endpoint (FQDN) of the gateway assigned to communicate with the API Management server. This cannot be the same as the endpoint for API requests.
* Endpoint (FQDN) of the Developer Portal service assigned to accept requests from clients.
* Endpoint (FQDN) of the Developer Portal assigned to communicate with the API Management server. This cannot be the same as the port for client requests.
* Endpoint (FQDN) of the Analytics service to accept requests from clients.
* The address, port and login credentials for an SMTP email server.

The information may be gathered from the following commands:
```
[root@think ~]# kubectl get ingress -A

### About this tutorial


In this tutorial you are going to complete the following:

* Initial Cloud Manager Console login
* Configure an Email Server
* Register a Gateway Service
* Register a Portal Service
* Register an Analytics Service
* Configure a Default Gateway Service

## Initial Cloud Manager Console login

Take the following steps to log in to the Cloud Manager user
interface for the first time.

1.  In a web browser, enter the management service URL:
    https://admin.think.ibm

    ![Cloud Manager login](img/01-cloud-manager-login.png)

2.  Enter the Cloud Administrator user name and password. The default
    values are admin for the user name and `7iron-hide` for the password.
3.  You are immediately required to change the admin password, as well
    as provide an email address for the cloud administrator. Enter the
    necessary information.

    > **Note**
    > If you forget your password and request a
    > password reset, the notification email is sent to this email
    > address. This action will use the email server set in the
    > **Notifications** section of the cloud **Settings**.

### Configure an Email Server


Take the following steps to configure an email server. This
configuration allows you to recover the admin password or receive other
important notifications.

1.  Click **Settings** icon in the left panel or **Configure Cloud** tile in home page. Go to **Notifications** page and click **Edit** button in **Sender and Email Server** section.
