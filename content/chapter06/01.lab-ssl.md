# Guided Exercise: Managing SSL Certificates

1. Download scripts to generate CA and certificates:
   
   ```
   [root@think ~]# git clone https://github.com/sstupkiewicz/ca-apic-script
   Cloning into 'ca-apic-script'...
   remote: Enumerating objects: 20, done.
   remote: Counting objects: 100% (6/6), done.
   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
   remote: Total 20 (delta 2), reused 6 (delta 2), pack-reused 14
   Unpacking objects: 100% (20/20), done.
   ```
2. Generate self-signed CA and certificates for user-facing components. This will generate following files:
   
   * ```cacert.pem``` - CA public certificate
   * ```cakey.pem``` - CA private key
   * ```<component>.pem``` - public certificate for a ```<component>```
   * ```<component>.key.pem``` - private key for a ```<component>```

   Where ```<component>``` is one of the following:
   
     * admin
     * manager
     * rgw
     * consumer
     * api
     * portal

   ```
   [root@think ~]# cd ca-apic-script/
   [root@think ca-apic-script]# ./create-ca.sh 
   Generating CA certificate and key. Complete!
   Generating certificate and key for admin.think.ibm .... Complete!
   Generating certificate and key for manager.think.ibm .... Complete!
   Generating certificate and key for consumer.think.ibm .... Complete!
   Generating certificate and key for api.think.ibm .... Complete!
   Generating certificate and key for portal.think.ibm .... Complete!
   Generating certificate and key for rgw.think.ibm .... Complete!
   ```

3. Create Kubernetes secrets from certificates and keys.
   
   ```
   [root@think ca-apic-script]# for ep in admin api consumer manager portal rgw; do kubectl create secret tls $ep-custom-endpoint --namespace=apiconnect --cert=$ep.pem --key=$ep.key.pem; done
   secret/admin-custom-endpoint created
   secret/api-custom-endpoint created
   secret/consumer-custom-endpoint created
   secret/manager-custom-endpoint created
   secret/portal-custom-endpoint created
   secret/rgw-custom-endpoint created
   ```

4. Edit ManagementCluster CR:
   ```
   k edit mgmt management
   ```
   Edit the following lines:
   ```yaml
   spec:
   apiManagerEndpoint:
      annotations:
         certmanager.k8s.io/issuer: ingress-issuer
      hosts:
      - name: manager.think.ibm
         secretName: apim-endpoint
   cloudManagerEndpoint:
      annotations:
         certmanager.k8s.io/issuer: ingress-issuer
      hosts:
      - name: admin.think.ibm
         secretName: cm-endpoint
   consumerAPIEndpoint:
      annotations:
         certmanager.k8s.io/issuer: ingress-issuer
      hosts:
      - name: consumer.think.ibm
         secretName: consumer-endpoint
   platformAPIEndpoint:
      annotations:
         certmanager.k8s.io/issuer: ingress-issuer
      hosts:
      - name: api.think.ibm
         secretName: api-endpoint
   ```
   To have following values:
   ```yaml
   spec:
   apiManagerEndpoint:
      hosts:
      - name: manager.think.ibm
         secretName: manager-custom-endpoint
   cloudManagerEndpoint:
      hosts:
      - name: admin.think.ibm
         secretName: admin-custom-endpoint
   consumerAPIEndpoint:
      hosts:
      - name: consumer.think.ibm
         secretName: consumer-custom-endpoint
   platformAPIEndpoint:
      hosts:
      - name: api.think.ibm
         secretName: api-custom-endpoint
   ```
   Save the file and exit editor.
5. Edit PortalCluster CR:
   ```
   k edit ptl portal
   ```
   Edit the following lines:
   ```yaml
   spec:
   portalUIEndpoint:
      annotations:
         certmanager.k8s.io/issuer: ingress-issuer
      hosts:
      - name: portal.think.ibm
         secretName: portal-web

   ```
   To the following:
   ```yaml
   spec:
   portalUIEndpoint:
      hosts:
      - name: portal.think.ibm
         secretName: portal-custom-endpoint
   ```
   Write the file and exit.

6. Install self-signed CA into your browser.
   
   * In Firefox, go to ```Settings -> Privacy and Security```, scroll down to ```Certificates``` section and select ```View Certificates...```.
     In ```Authorities``` tab select ```Import...``` and select your ```cacert.pem``` file.

7. Verify that Cloud Manager interface is now available with new certificate.

8. Install new TLS Server Profile for gateway.
   
   1. In Cloud Manager go to ```Resources -> TLS```. Click ```Create``` in ```Truststore``` section.
   2. Name your new truststore as "Self-signed CA". Upload your ```cacert.pem``` file. Click save.
   3. Go to ```Resources -> TLS```. Click ```Create``` in ```Keystore``` section.
   4. Name your new keystore as "GW self-signed CA". Upload your ```gw.key.pem``` and ```gw.pem``` files respectively as private key and certificate.
   5. Go to ```Resources -> TLS```. Click ```Create``` in ```TLS Server Profile``` section.
   6. Name your new TLS Server Profile as "GW Self-signed profile". Select previously created Keystore and Truststore. Click ```Save```.
   7. Go to ```Topology``` and edit your DataPower API Gateway Service. In "API Invocation Endpoint" section, "Server Name Indication (SNI)"
      subsection select "GW Self-signed profile" in "TLS Server Profile" field. Click ```Save```.
   After a while new certificate will be presented for every call to the gateway.

9. Verify that newly installed certificates are presented by visiting ```https://rgw.think.ibm``` in your browser.
