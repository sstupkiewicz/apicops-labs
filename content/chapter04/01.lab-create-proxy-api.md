    | zip_code |	The zip code of the address 	| string |	92122 |

    This is an OpenAPI schema definition and is presented to developers in the Developer Portal to provide them with information about the type of data to expect in their response. 

12. Click Save.
13. Create a second definition by clicking Add in the Definitions panel.
14. Name the definition branch and, in the Description field, enter The format of the branch field.
15. Configure the branch definition to have the properties listed in the following table by creating new properties and editing the default property. Create new properties by clicking Add.
Tip: Use ```uuidgen``` command to generate an example for id field. 

    | Property Name | Description | Type | Example |
    |---------------|-------------|------|---------|
    | address |	The address of the branch |	address |	 
    | type |	The type of branch |	string |	atm|
    | id |	The ID of the branch |	string | 9d72ece0-7e7b-11e5-9038-55f9f9c08c06|

16. Click Save.
17. In the side bar, select Paths to display the Paths panel.

    3.  Enter 200 OK in the DESCRIPTION field.
27. Click Save.

## Test the REST API

1. Press **Offline** toggle next to **Save** button. This does the following:
   1. Create automatic product and publish it in Sandbox catalog.
   2. Create subscription from Test Application to automatic product.
   3. Enables *Endpoints* and *Test* tabs in API Development to be available.
2. Go to **Test** tab:
   ![Test](img/06-test.png)
3. Click **Send**. You should get following error:
   ![CORS Error](img/07-cors-error.png)
   This error is raised, as currently Gateway Service is using self-signed certificate to secure API Traffic.
4. Click on the link and accept self-signed certificate. Close the newly opened tab after accepting self-signed certificate.
5. Click **Send** again. You should now receive correct response:
   ![API Response](img/08-api-response.png)

Congratulations, you have successfully created and tested an API!
